    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These simple scones are very easy to make. You can customize them by adding dried fruit, poppy seeds, or lemon zest.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; cut in butter with 2 knives or a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk milk and egg in a small bowl; gradually stir into flour mixture until moistened.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly, 5 or 6 turns. Pat or roll dough out into a 1/2-inch thick round. Cut into 8 wedge-shaped pieces and place onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake scones in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
